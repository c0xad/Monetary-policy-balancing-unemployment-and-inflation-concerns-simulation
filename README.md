The interactive dashboard I've created allows users to explore the relationships between unemployment, inflation, and the federal funds rate. It includes:

Sliders to adjust key economic indicators.
A "Simulate Next Period" button to see how changes in one variable affect others.
A line chart showing the trends of these indicators over time.
The Phillips Curve equation, which models the relationship between unemployment and inflation.

This dashboard can help users understand the complex decisions the Federal Reserve faces when setting monetary policy, balancing unemployment and inflation concerns.
